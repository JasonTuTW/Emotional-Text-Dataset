10021,"For my part , xiangqi . Maybe it's because my girlfriend is Chinese .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
10022,"I think chess is more reasonable . You see , each side has eight pawns , a larger number than that of the soldiers in xiangqi . A true battle should be like that . Soldiers should outnumber the commanders .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
10023,"Quite right . And unlike the soldiers in xiangqi , the pawns in chess can promote once they reach the furthest rank . It is very agreeable to grant merits to people with good performance .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
10024,"Correct ! Another contrast is the rules for the general and the king . It seems the general or marshal in xiangqi is much too incompetent . They are required to stay in the palace , waiting to be checked and fleeing for life under the cover of the guards . Look at the king in chess , he is much more capable .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
10025,"Yeah , and though the king in chess doesn't have bodyguards , he has a queen who is the most powerful piece . I think this demonstrates the relatively higher social status of aristocratic women in medieval Europe than in China .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
10026,"There's another distinctive contrast . Both board games use a total of 32 pieces , but xiangqi is played on a 9 - by - 9 board , bigger than the 8 - by - 8 board used in chess .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
10027,"You mean , xiangqi pieces are allowed a larger space in which to move around ?",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
10028,"Sure . On a chessboard , fire is much more intensive . It has a smaller board , while those bigger pieces-chariots , horses and bishops-can cover longer distances .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0

The table arrangements and serving order for a social party are equally complicated . Each dish should be placed in the correct position . When fish is served , the tail should be pointing at the guest because tail meat is supposed to be tasty . If it is in winter , the stomach should face the right-hand side of the guest because that portion of the fish is very rich in winter . Each dish should be commenced by the eldest person who is seated at the head of the table . The diners should sit close to the table so food won ’ t drop on their cloths .

18696,"Hmm , that's a bit of a challenge . Sushi is notoriously difficult to pair with wine . Well , let's see . have to be a white wine , of course .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
18697,"Why ? Wouldn't a red wine go well with sushi ?",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
18698,"No , I don't think so . Sushi is a very delicately flavored food , and red wine would be a jarring contrast . You need a white wine , which has more subtle flavors , to complement the fish .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0

18700,"Yes , Chardonnay is a white wine , but I'm not sure it'd be your best bet . Chardonnay is one of the more fullbodied whites , and tends to be a bit oaky . I'd suggest that you go for something brighter , like this Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0

18705,"All right . What varietal is that ?",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
18706,"Well , this is a French wine , so they don't always specify the varietal on the label .

25605,"Well , when the finish is dry , the table is done .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
25606,"It all sounds very complicated .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0

25635,"Well , you can buy him a pet iguana then .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
25636,"That's a cool idea . At least it would be a surprise.But I'm afraid he wouldn't take care of it .",0,0,0,0,1,0,0
25637,"He would think you were crazy , Caroline .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
25638,"Yes . An iguana is too strange for a gift , and a tie is too normal.So I have to find something halfway between .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
25639,"How much do you want to spend ?",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
25640,"Well , he was very good to me.He helped me edit my essay for the scholarship contest.So I want to spend at least 75 dollars .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0

25642,"Yes .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
25643,"Well , he isn't a lawyer , so I don't think he needs to have a briefcase like that .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
25644,"What should he have then ?",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
25645,"I think he would appreciate having a very fine leather bag.But more like a workbag or shoulder bag.You know , not so hard and square like a briefcase .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0

25653,"How about the iguana ?",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
25654,"I think it would be a great joke.But I know we'd have to take the iguana back . And the pet store might not let us.So why don't we get him something else ? Some clothes maybe .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0

25668,"If your son wants to study film , probably he will start to collect movies himself .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
25669,"Yes , I know that . So I want him to have a good VCR to use .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
25670,"May I suggest you consider buying him a DVD player instead ?",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
25671,"DVD ? Isn't that like a CD ?",0,0,0,0,0,0,1
25672,"It is very similar . The technology is the same .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
25673,"Why is a DVD better than a VCR ?",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
25674,"For one thing , sir , the quality of the image is usually better.That ' s because it's digital .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
25675,"But isn't it more expensive ?",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
25676,"It is a little more expensive , sir.But there is one important advantage which your son might appreciate .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
25677,"What's that ?",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
25678,"If your son starts to buy video tapes , he can't keep them very long .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
25679,"And why not ?",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
25680,"Video tape breaks down after fifteen years.So if he collects a lot of tapes , after fifteen years they will all start to rot .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
25681,"Hmm . Is that true ?",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
25682,"Yes , it is , sir .",1,0,0,0,0,0,0
